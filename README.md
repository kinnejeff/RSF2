# RSF2
Read-Split-Fly version 2 - faster, more memory efficient, outputs to SAM and BED

At present, only a compiled binary for linux is included.  You simply download rsf2 and run rsf2 --help to see how to use it.  Many features are not included yet, but you can see what the options look like, etc.  See the "Run with default settings" portion of the rsf2 --help printout on what the default settings are.
